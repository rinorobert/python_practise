# 📘 Python Coding Practice

This repository is where I practise Python regularly and track my progress as I slowly move forward in my coding journey.
I’m a beginner and currently know only the basic concepts of Python, but I’m improving step by step through small, structured exercises.
As a B.Tech AI & Data Science student, this space helps me strengthen my fundamentals and build confidence in problem-solving.

## ⭐ What this repo is about

I created this repository to:

~ Strengthen my basic Python understanding
~ Improve logical thinking through simple daily problems
~ Get comfortable using VS Code and Jupyter Notebook
~ Build consistency in my learning journey
~ Maintain a clean record of my progress on GitHub

This is not an advanced project — just an honest place where I practise and grow.

## 📂 How everything is organised

The repository contains multiple Jupyter Notebook files.
Each notebook is named based on a practice number (for example, practice-01, practice-02 etc.).

## Every practice set includes:

~ A list of questions

~ Each question written in a Markdown cell

~ The solution code written right below it

This format helps me keep everything neat and easy to review later.

## 🧠 Skills I’m practising

~ Basic Python (loops, conditions, functions)
~ Lists, dictionaries, strings, and sets
~ Writing simple and readable code
~ Understanding basic problem-solving patterns
~ Learning Git & GitHub step by step

As I improve, I’ll add more challenging exercises and small mini-projects.

## 🛠 Tools I use

~ Python 3.x
~ VS Code
~ Jupyter Notebook
~ Git & GitHub
